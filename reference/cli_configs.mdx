Before using the Layerform CLI, you must configure it so it knows where to pull state and layer definitions from.

For that, you must edit the `configuration.yml` file in the `.layerform` folder within your `home` folder.

In that `configuration.yml` file you'll be able to add entries for contexts. Those contexts are the possible [Layerform back-ends](./backends) from which the CLI will pull state and layer definitions.

Each entry has a `type` and configurations specific to each type of back-end.

For example, to configure an S3 back-end you'd use a configuration similar to the one below.

```yaml
currentContext: example-context
contexts:
    example-context:
        type: s3
        bucket: layerform-bucket-example
```

This configuration allows your CLI to pull state and definitions fro the `s3` bucket called `layerform-bucket-example`. That way, your whole team can work together to create and update layer definitions, and share certain core parts of your infrastructure.

<Note>
    You must configure your desired S3 bucket so that all engineers using
    Layerform can read and write to it. Otherwise, they won't be able to read
    state and layer definitions, and won't be able to update state whenever they
    spin up new layer instances.
</Note>

### Configuring a local back-end

If you're just getting started, you can use a local back-end to test Layerform on your own.

The `local` back-end will point Layerform to store state and layer definitions in your own filesystem.

To configure a `local` back-end, you must use the `local` context type and set a directory through the `dir` key. Layerform will then use the path in `dir` to store state and layer definitions.

```yaml
currentContext: my-local-context
contexts:
    my-local-context:
        type: local
        dir: /Users/someone/project/layerform-backend
```

<Warning>
We don't recommend using local back-ends in a team context because state and layer definitions won't be automatically synced across different team members. Instead, they'll leave on each engineer's local filesystem.

You should only use a `local` back-end for testing and individual use.

</Warning>
