A layer definition is an entry in a JSON object. This entry includes a name, a list of dependencies, and the contents of the Terraform files Layerform will use to spawn infrastructure.

<Note>
_Layer definitions_ and _layer definition resources_ are two different concepts.

A _layer definition resource_ is the Terraform resource the Layerform provider uses to create an actual _layer definition_.

</Note>

## Creating layer definitions

To create a layer definition, you need to start by using the `layerform_layer_definition` Terraform resource in the Layerform provider.

```hcl
provider "layerform" {}

resource "layerform_layer_definition" "base_layer" {
  name   = "base"
  files = ["./eks.tf", "./eks/**"]
}

resource "layerform_layer_definition" "elastic_stack" {
  name   = "elastic_stack"
  files = ["./elastic_stack.tf", "./elastic_stack/**"]
  dependencies = [base_layer.name]
}
```

Each of these resources takes a `name`, a list of `files`, and may take a list of `dependencies`.

Here's what each input does:

1. `name`: an unique name for this layer definition. You'll use this name in the CLI to spawn instances of this layer definition.
2. `files`: a list of Terraform files included in this layer. Layerform will run these files to provision infrastructure for an instance of this layer definition.
3. `dependencies`: a list layer definition names upon which instances of the current layer will be placed.

**Once you have a `layerform_layer_definition` resource, you should run `terraform apply` to actually create the layer definition entry in the JSON object in your Layerform back-end.**

<Note>
    By default, Layerform uses the local filesystem as its back-end. [See this
    page to learn more about Layerform back-ends](./backends).
</Note>

## Using layer definitions

Layer definitions are used by the Layerform CLI so it knows which Terraform files to run to create a layer instance. Layerform also looks at the `dependencies` list to fetch state for any underlying layers.

To use a layer definition, you must configure your CLI with the back-end containing the desired definition. For that, you must edit the `configurations.yml` file within `~/.layerform`.

In that file, you should configure a context with the desired type and its settings. Then, you should set `currentContext to the desired context's name.

```yaml
currentContext: tutorial-context
contexts:
    tutorial-context:
        type: s3
        bucket: layerform-bucket-example
```

After that, you can spawn layers using `layerform spawn <layer_definition_name> <desired_id>`. The `layerform spawn` command will pull the matching definition from the specified context and run its Terraform files.

## Updating or deleting layer definitions

To update a layer definition, you must update the Terraform files associated with it and run `terraform apply` again. That will cause the Layerform provider to update the back-end with your updated files.

To delete a particular layer definition, you can simply remove the corresponding `layerform_layer_definition` resource from your Terraform file and run `terraform apply` again.
