A layer definition is an entry in a JSON object. This entry includes a name, a list of dependencies, and the contents of the Terraform files Layerform will use to spawn infrastructure.

<Note>
_Layer definitions_ and _layer definition resources_ are two different concepts.

A _layer definition resource_ is the Terraform resource the Layerform provider uses to create an actual _layer definition_.

</Note>

## Creating layer definitions

To create a layer definition, you need to start by using the `layerform_layer_definition` Terraform resource in the Layerform provider.

```hcl
provider "layerform" {}

resource "layerform_layer_definition" "base_layer" {
  name   = "base"
  files = ["./eks.tf", "./eks/**"]
}

resource "layerform_layer_definition" "elastic_stack" {
  name   = "elastic_stack"
  files = ["./elastic_stack.tf", "./elastic_stack/**"]
  dependencies = [base_layer.name]
}
```

Each of these resources takes a `name`, a list of `files`, and may take a list of `dependencies`.

Here's what each input does:

1. `name`: an unique name for this layer definition. You'll use this name in the CLI to spawn instances of this layer definition.
2. `files`: a list of Terraform files included in this layer. Layerform will run these files to provision infrastructure for an instance of this layer definition.
3. `dependencies`: a list layer definition names upon which instances of the current layer will be placed.

**Once you have a `layerform_layer_definition` resource, you should run `terraform apply` to actually create the layer definition entry in the JSON object in your Layerform back-end.**

<Note>
    By default, Layerform uses the local filesystem as its back-end. [See this
    page to learn more about Layerform back-ends](./backends).
</Note>

### Creating Terraform files for layer definitions

**By convention, you should encapsulate your layer definitions' Terraform files into [Terraform modules](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules).**

Encapsulating layer definitions into modules makes it easier to understand which files belong to each layer.

For example, if you have an `elastic_stack` layer, you'd have `kibana.tf` and `elasticsearch.tf` files within a folder called `elastic_stack`. That folder would also have any necessary inputs and outputs in `inputs.tf` and `outputs.tf` files.

```
layerform/
└─ elastic_stack/
    ├─ elasticsearch.tf
    ├─ kibana.tf
    ├─ inputs.tf
    └─ outputs.tf
```

Don't forget to also create an entry-point instantiating your module.

```
layerform/
├─ elastic_stack/
│   ├─ elasticsearch.tf
│   ├─ kibana.tf
│   ├─ inputs.tf
│   └─ outputs.tf
└─ entrypoint.tf <--- uses the module elastic_stack
```

This entrypoint should instantiate the module and pass the necessary inputs to it.

```hcl
module "elastic_stack" {
    source = "./modules/elastic_stack"
    cluster_id = modules.eks.cluster_id
}
```

Then, when creating the `layerform_layer_definition` resource, make sure to include both the entrypoint and all the files in the module's folder.

```hcl
resource "layerform_layer_definition" "elastic_stack" {
  name   = "elastic_stack"
  files = ["./elastic_stack.tf", "./elastic_stack/**"]
}
```

### Using variables across layer definitions

When using layer definitions, keep in mind that you can reference variables from another definition if, and only if, the reference variable belongs to the layer _below_.

For example, it's fine if your `elastic_stack` layer must take an `input` which comes from the `eks` module which is part of the underlying `eks` layer.

```hcl
module "elastic_stack" {
    source = "./modules/elastic_stack"

    # This cluster_id reference comes from a file which
    # belongs to the underlying `eks` layer. That's fine.
    cluster_id = modules.eks.cluster_id
}
```

On the other hand, it's not fine if your `eks` layer references values from the `elastic_stack` layer on top of it.

```hcl
# This code won't work
module "eks" {
    source = "./modules/eks"

    # This is NOT fine! Here, the reference comes from the
    # elastic_stack layer on *top*. Which won't be available.
    cluster_id = modules.elastic_stack.elasticsearch_url
}
```

<Tip>
    Encapsulating layers into modules makes it easier to understand whether
    you're referencing values in the layers below, above, or next to the target
    layer.
</Tip>

## Using layer definitions

Layer definitions are used by the Layerform CLI so it knows which Terraform files to run to create a layer instance. Layerform also looks at the `dependencies` list to fetch state for any underlying layers.

To use a layer definition, you must configure your CLI with the back-end containing the desired definition. For that, you must edit the `configurations.yml` file within `~/.layerform`.

In that file, you should configure a context with the desired type and its settings. Then, you should set `currentContext to the desired context's name.

```yaml
currentContext: tutorial-context
contexts:
    tutorial-context:
        type: s3
        bucket: layerform-bucket-example
```

After that, you can spawn layers using `layerform spawn <layer_definition_name> <desired_id>`. The `layerform spawn` command will pull the matching definition from the specified context and run its Terraform files.

## Updating or deleting layer definitions

To update a layer definition, you must update the Terraform files associated with it and run `terraform apply` again. That will cause the Layerform provider to update the back-end with your updated files.

To delete a particular layer definition, you can simply remove the corresponding `layerform_layer_definition` resource from your Terraform file and run `terraform apply` again.
