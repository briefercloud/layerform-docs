A Layerform back-end is where Layerform stores layer definitions and the states for each layer instance.

There are two moments when you interface with a Layerform back-end. The first is when you provision the back-end with layer definitions.

The second is when a Layerform CLI user runs a `spawn` or `kill` command. Those commands cause the CLI to fetch layer definitions and the necessary pieces of state. The CLI will also update the state in the back-end when it changes.

## Types of back-ends

There are two types of back-ends: `local` and `s3`.

The `local` back-end means you will store state and layer definitions on disk.

The problem with using the `local` back-end is that other members of the team won't have access to your layer definitions and their state.

The `s3` back-end specifies the S3 bucket into which Layerform will store layer definitions and state.

By using an `s3` back-end you enable your whole team to fetch the definitions you provisioned. Additionally, your team can share core pieces of infrastructure because they will have access to shared state in the cloud.

## Provisioning (Configuration Step)

To provision a back-end, you must first specify the desired back-end when defining the Layerform provider in your Terraform file.

```hcl
provider "layerform" {
    backend {
        type = "s3"
        bucket = "layerform-bucket-example"
    }
}
```

After configuring the desired back-end, you can run Terraform apply to create a `layerform_layer_definition` resource in that back-end.

```hcl
resource "layerform_layer_definition" "base_layer" {
  name   = "base"
  files = ["./eks.tf", "./eks/**"]
}
```

Once you run `terraform apply` on a `layerform_layer_definition` resource, Layerform will take care of generating the JSON layer definition files for you, and uploading them to your bucket.

## Using (Usage Step)

Users directly interface with the back-end when they run `layerform spawn` and `layerform kill`.

Those commands cause the Layerform CLI to fetch state and layer definitions from the back-end so it knows which Terraform files to run.

After running the Terraform files necessary to create an instance of the desired layer definition, Layerform will upload the updated layer state to your back-end.

## Configuration

To configure your CLI to use a particular back-end, you must remember to update the `configurations.yml` file within `~/.layerform` so it pulls and writes data to the correct place.

To use an S3 bucket, you must add a `context` entry whose `type` is `s3`. That entry must specify the bucket's name under the `bucket` key.

Then, you should set `currentContext` to the name of your S3 context, as shown below.

```yaml
currentContext: remote-context
contexts:
    remote-context:
        type: s3
        bucket: layerform-bucket-example
```

<Warning>
Please create a bucket exclusively for Layerform when using an S3 bucket as a back-end.

Layerform should always have its own bucket for storing layer states and definitions. Otherwise, it may overwrite existing files.

</Warning>

### Using the local filesystem

To use the local filesystem back-end your `context` entry must use the type `local` and specify the directory containing your layer definitions and state.

```yaml
currentContext: my-local-context
contexts:
    my-local-context:
        type: local
        dir: /Users/someone/project/layerform-backend
    remote-context:
        type: s3
        bucket: layerform-bucket-example
```
